> Context engineering and pragmatism over tool hype. Leading a dev team shipping headless commerce and cms projects with actual efficiency gains – not decks about them.

## Current Projects

- 🧠 **[skills](https://github.com/bartundmett/skills)** - Agent skills for Shopware, Storyblok, Intershop & more – context that makes AI useful
- 🧱 **[bloktastic](https://github.com/bartundmett/bloktastic)** - Storyblok component registry, ship prompts not code
- 🍌 **[benana](https://github.com/bartundmett/benana)** - Gemini-powered image generation desktop mac app
- 🏥 **[bloktor](https://github.com/bartundmett/bloktor)** - ESLint, but for Storyblok Space Setups

## What I'm Doing

- **AI-native delivery** – Building workflows where AI has the right context to actually ship, not just suggest
- **Context engineering** – Spending time on skill files and structured knowledge instead of hoping for magic
- **Agentic commerce** – MCP servers and agent skills that turn e-commerce platforms into something AI can work with
- **Writing on LinkedIn** – About what happens when you stop treating AI as autocomplete
- **Storyblok MVP**
- **Just having fun.**

I will be at K5 in Berlin this year, presenting the synaigy AI Factory and a customer case.
You could say it's AI delivery in practice.
